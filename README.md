# Charlotte Townhome Finder

A full-stack aggregator dashboard for new construction townhomes in the greater Charlotte, NC area — like Jome.com but built for you, focused on Charlotte, and connected to your Gmail.

## What it does

- **Aggregates** listings from Zillow, Realtor.com, Opendoor, Homes.com, NewHomeSource, and direct builder websites (D.R. Horton, Lennar, Ryan Homes, Meritage, Eastwood, Smith Douglas, and more)
- **Tracks price cuts** — shows original vs. current price, % reduction, and dollar savings
- **Scans your Gmail** daily for real estate alerts, builder emails, and price-drop notifications
- **Runs on a schedule** — automatic refresh at 7 AM and 12 PM Eastern every day
- **Dashboard** — filter by price, beds, city, builder, source; sort by price cut %, freshness, size; click any listing to see details + price history chart + call button

## Quick start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm run setup

# Start both server (port 3001) + client (port 5173) together
npm run dev
```

Then open **http://localhost:5173**

## Gmail — already wired up (no setup)

This app reads your inbox through the **Gmail connector**, so there are no OAuth
credentials to configure. A scheduled daily scan reads
`***REDACTED-EMAIL***` for builder emails (Ryan Homes, David Weekley…),
Zillow/Redfin price-cut alerts, and open houses, then writes the results to:

- `server/data/gmail-listings.json` — full listings (price, beds/baths/sqft, builder, phone) → shown in the dashboard as the **📧 Your Inbox** source
- `server/data/gmail-leads.json` — price-cut / open-house / builder alerts → shown in the **Email Leads** tab

The server ingests these files on every scrape, so your real inbox data flows
straight into the listings grid alongside the other sources. See
[`AUTOMATION.md`](AUTOMATION.md) for how the daily scan is scheduled.

### Optional: direct OAuth mode
If you'd rather have the server hit the Gmail API itself (instead of the
connector-driven file refresh), copy `server/.env.example` → `server/.env` and
fill in `GMAIL_CLIENT_ID` / `GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET` / `GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN`. The
server auto-detects credentials and uses them when present.

## Notes on scraping

Most aggregator sites (Zillow, Realtor.com, etc.) block automated requests — the server gracefully falls back to curated sample data so the dashboard always has content. As those sites update their bot-protection policies, the scrapers automatically get the real data when available. Builder sites (D.R. Horton, Lennar, etc.) tend to be more accessible.

For production use, consider adding a RapidAPI key for enhanced Zillow/Realtor.com access.
